Package `polar` (`github.com/psyb0t/go-polar`) provides typed REST methods for products, customers, subscriptions, checkouts, orders, payments, benefits, usage events, meters, refunds and webhook management.

# go-polar

Unofficial, typed Go client for the Polar API, in package `polar` at the module root.

For install, operation examples, pagination and response fields, see [references/setup.md](references/setup.md).

## Security & safety

- Read a bearer access token from `POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN`. Never hardcode, commit or log it, and never print a request with its `Authorization` header.
- Use `https://api.polar.sh` for production or `https://sandbox-api.polar.sh` for sandbox. Select the environment the user requested.
- Create, update, delete, refund and revoke operations change account data. Call them only when the user requested that action.
- Use the token type and scopes the operation requires. Customer portal and member operations use their corresponding session tokens.

## When to use

- Go code needs Polar products, customers, subscriptions, orders, checkouts, benefits or usage billing.
- Go code needs to change Polar account data at the user's request.
- The project already imports `github.com/psyb0t/go-polar`.

## When NOT to use

- The code is not Go. This module ships only a Go package.
- You need a client maintained by Polar. This one is unofficial and not affiliated with Polar.
- You want to change the generated client itself. See `AGENTS.md` in the repo.

## Usage

Create a client with `polar.NewClientWithResponses` and a `polar.WithRequestEditorFn` option that sets `Authorization` to `Bearer ` followed by the access token. Use the host URL without a `/v1` suffix.

`ProductsListWithResponse(ctx, &polar.ProductsListParams{})` lists products. `CustomersListWithResponse(ctx, &polar.CustomersListParams{})` lists customers. `CustomersCreateWithResponse` accepts a generated customer-create union; construct a branch using the generated `FromCustomerIndividualCreate` or `FromCustomerTeamCreate` helper. Decode a customer union with `AsCustomerIndividual` or `AsCustomerTeam`.

The Go error return covers transport and decoding failures. Inspect `StatusCode()` and the matching success field, such as `JSON200` or `JSON201`, before using a response. Unsupported status bodies remain available in `Body`.

Nullable fields can be pointers; check for nil before dereferencing. Number fields use `float64`; integer minor-unit amounts remain integers. Scalar-or-array query filters take slices; use one element for a single value. List methods do not paginate automatically. Continue with `Page` until the response's `Pagination.MaxPage` is reached.
